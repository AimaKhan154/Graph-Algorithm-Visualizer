ðŸ“š Data Structures Used in the Project
This project utilizes several fundamental data structures to efficiently represent and process graph elements and algorithms.

1. Graph
The graph is the core data structure representing a collection of connected vertices (nodes) and edges (connections). It integrates visual components and logical representations to facilitate interaction, visualization, and algorithm execution.

Key Features
Adding and Removing Vertices:

Users can add vertices by clicking on the canvas and assigning a unique ID.
Vertices are stored in a static map and visually displayed on the JPanel.
Adding and Removing Edges:

Users can connect two vertices by selecting them sequentially.
Edges are represented both visually and logically.
Interactivity:

Graph interactions are handled through mouse clicks.
User actions are validated to ensure proper functionality.
Algorithms:

The graph structure is converted into an adjacency list for algorithm input.
Algorithms such as BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra's run on the graph, with results displayed visually.
Visualization:

Graphs are visualized on a JPanel, with vertices and edges rendered dynamically.
Labels and shapes represent weights and connections for clarity.
Graph Representation in Code
Vertices:

Represented as instances of the Vertex class.
Rendered as small panels on the GUI.
Edges:

Represented as instances of the Edge class.
Can connect two vertices and optionally carry a weight.
2. Maps
A Map stores key-value pairs, where keys are unique, and each key maps to a specific value.

Usage in the Project
Key (Vertex): Represents a graph node. Each Vertex object acts as a unique key.
Value (List<Edge>): Represents edges originating from a vertex. Each vertex maps to a list of its edges.
3. Lists
A List is an ordered collection of elements that allows duplicates and provides dynamic resizing.

Usage in the Project
Storing Vertices:

The vertices list in the Graph class holds all graph vertices, enabling dynamic addition and removal.
Storing Edges:

The availableEdges list stores all graph edges, allowing efficient management of edge operations.
Temporary Storage:

The edgeVertices list temporarily holds vertices during edge operations for consistency and efficiency.
Iteration:

Lists are iterated over for tasks like printing edges or processing graph data.
4. Sets (HashSet)
A Set holds a collection of unique elements. It is ideal for ensuring no duplicates and for quick lookups.

Usage in the Project
Visited Vertices:

In BFS, DFS, and Primâ€™s Algorithm, a Set<Vertex> keeps track of visited vertices to prevent redundant processing.
Dijkstra's Algorithm:

A set can track unprocessed vertices, ensuring efficient traversal.
5. Queue
A Queue follows the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) principle, ideal for processing elements in order.

Usage in the Project
Breadth-First Search (BFS):

A Queue<Vertex> ensures vertices are processed level by level.
Priority Queue (Min-Heap):

In advanced implementations of Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm or Primâ€™s Algorithm, a PriorityQueue<Vertex> can prioritize vertices with the smallest tentative distance.
